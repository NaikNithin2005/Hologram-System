## 🧠 Core Innovation

Unlike systems that depend on pre-trained models, this project is built using:

- Custom-collected real-world gesture datasets  
- Self-trained machine learning models  
- Voice command models trained on real user speech samples  
- Optimized real-time inference pipeline

## 🧠 Advanced Algorithms & Technology

### 1. Computer Vision (Custom Hand Gesture Recognition)

The gesture system is built entirely from scratch using real-world data:

- **Dataset Collection**
  - Captured multiple gestures (pinch, swipe, thumbs up, point)
  - Includes variations in lighting, backgrounds, and users  

- **Preprocessing**
  - Hand segmentation using OpenCV  
  - Frame normalization and noise reduction  

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Extraction of finger joint relationships  
  - Distance and angle-based feature calculation  

- **Model Training**
  - Custom CNN + keypoint-based classifier  
  - Trained on labeled gesture dataset  

- **Gesture Detection**
  - Real-time classification  
  - Temporal smoothing for stability  
  - Threshold-based filtering

### 2. Natural Language Processing (Custom Voice Recognition)

Voice interaction is powered by a model trained on real speech data:

- **Dataset Collection**
  - Multiple users recording commands (Next, Rotate, Stop, etc.)  
  - Includes noise and accent variations  

- **Feature Extraction**
  - MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)  

- **Model Training**
  - RNN / LSTM-based classifier  
  - Maps voice patterns to system actions  

- **Execution Pipeline**
  - Audio → Feature Extraction → Classification → Action
